This is a senior full-stack engineer role. This position requires the ability to design, build, and operate full-stack systems, including scalable APIs, secure data flows, and performant, responsive UIs. It involves working with a modern stack such as Go, gRPC, PostgreSQL, React, and AWS, and delivering features end-to-end—from breaking down requirements and estimating work to collaborating with product, design, and engineering. The role also demands strong architectural decision-making to ensure scalability and maintainability, while championing engineering excellence through improved tooling, testing, and mentoring. A practical understanding of AI technologies is expected, identifying opportunities where automation or machine learning can enhance user experience. Success in this role depends on clear communication, strong collaboration, a growth mindset, and a commitment to delivering high-quality, customer-focused solutions aligned with business goals.
